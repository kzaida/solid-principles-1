# SOLID principles

## Dependency inversion principle

* Not the same as dependency injection!
* Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
    * High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Instead they should depend upon abstractions.
    * Low level modules too should depend upon abstractions.
* *High level code* isnâ€™t concerned with the specific details.
* *Low level code* is more concerned with details and specifics.
* All of this allows for decoupling.
